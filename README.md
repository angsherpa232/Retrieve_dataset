# Give Our Data - API

This RESTful API is based on the study carried out for partial fulfillment of the requirements for the degree of Master of Science in Geospatial Technologies at the [Institute for Geoinformatics](https://www.uni-muenster.de/Geoinformatics/en/) in 2018-19. The thesis is entitled **_"Querying with ease to retrieve spatial datasets through an Application Programming Interface (API)"._**  The main focus was to come up with easy and a user-friendly way of querying the datasets in terms of parameters namely SPACE, THEME, AND TIME from API level. Details about each parameter along with sample of different queries for respective number of parameter is given in this [documentation](https://documenter.getpostman.com/view/5553462/RzffJ9cc).

The front-end was developed with [React](https://reactjs.org/) to evaluate the learnability of the API developed for this study.
